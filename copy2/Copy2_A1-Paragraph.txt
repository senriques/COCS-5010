// Assignment 1.8 Written Paragraph "Disadvantages of ioutil.ReadFile"

Some of the disadvangtage to reading and writing in data from a file using ReadFile instead of 
io.copy is that ReadFile will read the entire contents of the file as a binary slice and then 
the dataneeds to be 'decoded' and parsed into the individual data structures then rewritten 
into the new file.  Whereas in  io.copy the file is simply opened and copied into another file.  
I am not sure how io.copy implements, but assume that ReadFile is much more memory intensive as 
ReadFile loads all the data into memory where io.copy probably reads and writes bits into and 
out of the file without loading the entire file into memory.
